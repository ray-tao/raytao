            The Garden of Forking Paths is a mind-twisting short story by Jorge Luis Borges. It tells the story of Yu Tsun, a Chinese spy for the Germans whose cover has been blown and needs to make a move fast. To reveal his information to the Germans, he needs to send a message by killing a man with a last name Albert. This just so happened to be Stephen Albert, a sinologist who studied the history of Yu Tsun's ancestors and the only person in the world who understood Yu Tsun's great grandfather's infamous novel about a labyrinth. Yu Tsun, despite being chased by his capturer, sits down and listens to Dr Albert's findings in a weird, calmly manner, putting aside his time-sensitive goal of murdering Albert completely. During this talk was when he found out that his ancestor discovered that time is not absolute, diverging and converging into infinite futures, something that was revolutionary to Yu Tsun as the mysteries of his ancestors were finally solved. Shortly after thanking Dr Albert, Yu Tsun pulls out his gun with a single bullet and murders him, successfully sending out the secret message to his German Boss while being captured. In this moment in time, all of Yu Tsun's "paths" had converged into one reality: his death. By betraying and murdering his beloved friend, he has proved to his xenophobic boss that a Chinese man like him can save an entire army, though this confliction left him an "infinite penitence and sickness of the heart" (Borges, 8).
